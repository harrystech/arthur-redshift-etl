# Facilitates monitoring scheduled Arthur jobs by sending an HTTP GET request
# to a specified URI.
#
# This script is called near the beginning and end of Arthur data pipelines.
# The service that receives the GET request is expected to sound an alarm if
# it does not receive the second request within some configured amount of
# time.
#
# The script expects this environment variable to be set:
#   HEALTH_CHECK_URI - URI to the job-specific endpoint for monitoring
#
# The environment variable is usually set in the environment.sh file. It may
# also be simply exported from the current shell, as an alternative.
#
# The HTTP endpoint is expected to handle requests to these three resources:
#   HEALTH_CHECK_URI - The bare URI itself, when the job completes
#   HEALTH_CHECK_URI/start - To indicate the job has started
#   HEALTH_CHECK_URI/fail - To explicitly indicate job failure
